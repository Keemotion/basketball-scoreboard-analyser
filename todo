configuration keys in UI
change configuration keys in UI
TO ASK: 
	default configuration keys?
	objects grouped meaningfully vs optimally (for keys)
display pattern functions 
debug: add digit for new configuration
selecting by double-clicking inside the digit
mouse pointer change: over edge -> move digit, on corner -> move corner, else: drag canvas
hovering in toggle mode for patterns -> display RGB/grayscale values of current pixel
---CURRENT---
x mouse pointer depending on mode
x mouse mode enabled button color
x clear configuration -> clear selection tree
delete element -> remove from selection tree 
x add configuration keys to tree
add configuration keys to group at a certain index (draggable)
change global configuration keys (details view)
	*type with corresponding list of values
	*type depending on context
group-configuration-keys details view (details view)
	collapsed div containing all inherited/default values
	list of select(type) and select(value) + remove-button
	add-button to add a new key
double-click to select surrounding element
drag mode enabled when approaching a selected object
---AUTOMATISATION---
right click inside digit -> finds surrounding digit
	*max variance shears
	*per max variance shear, find direction of line through
---

-------
automatisation
------
select starting and end led -> auto find all leds in between by equal-spacing (not recognizing)
find center of led by recognizing

first try digit recognizing: 
	maximize variance in luminance by shearing -> greedy
second try: (if no success)
	Fast Fourier/..?
