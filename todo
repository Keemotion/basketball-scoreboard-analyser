---AUTOMATISATION---
right click inside digit -> finds surrounding digit
	max variance shears
	per max variance shear, find direction of line through

automatisation
------
select starting and end led -> auto find all leds in between by equal-spacing (not recognizing)
find center of led by recognizing

first try digit recognizing: 
	maximize variance in luminance by shearing -> greedy
second try: (if no success)
	Fast Fourier/..?
