optimize exporter (group settings)
configuration keys in UI
TO ASK: 
    default configuration keys?
    objects grouped meaningfully vs optimally (for keys)
export last number for digits
other color for current selected digit/group
show configuration values
display pattern functions 
optimize: minimize number of lines
configuration keys after the definition (digits/leds)
move whole digit at once
move whole group of leds at once
select a set of groups and move it at once
selecting by square selection + selecting/deselecting by shift+click
debug: add digit for new configuration

selecting for moving: find closest one, but larger area than 5 px
default: don't display green circles, only when working on that one (selected digits: all info)
selecting by clicking inside the digit

display bug: rounding corners

mouse pointer change: over edge -> move digit, on corner -> move corner, else: drag canvas


hovering in toggle mode for patterns -> display RGB/grayscale values of current pixel

-------
automisation
------
select starting and end led -> auto find all leds in between by equal-spacing (not recognizing)
find center of led by recognizing

first try digit recognizing: 
    maximize variance in luminance by shearing -> greedy
second try: (if no success)
    Fast Fourier/..?
